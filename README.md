# Pokemon App 🐾

This application demonstrates the use of MVVM architecture to show a list and details of Pokémon using Swift and SwiftUI. The project emphasizes clean code principles and adheres to the SOLID principles.

## Features ✨
- Display a list of Pokémon.
- Show detailed information about a selected Pokémon.
- Network layer to handle API calls.
- Local caching for improved performance and offline support.

## Architecture 🏛️
The project uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to maintain a clean separation of concerns.

### Components 🧩
- **PokemonListView**: The main view to display the list of Pokémon.
- **PokemonListViewModel**: The view model for `PokemonListView`, managing data fetching and state.
- **PokemonDetailView**: The view to display detailed information about a selected Pokémon.
- **PokemonDetailViewModel**: The view model for `PokemonDetailView`, managing detailed data fetching and state.

### Networking 🌐
All networking-related functionality is grouped in a separate folder to maintain a clear structure.

### Repository 📦
- **PokemonRepository**: Acts as a middle layer between the view models and the data sources. It hides the complexity of data fetching, cache checking, and saving data to the cache.

### Local Data Service 🗄️
- **LocalDataService**: Used for caching data locally. Currently, it uses `UserDefaults` but can be optimized to use `CoreData` or the file system for better performance and scalability.

## Installation 🛠️
1. Ensure you have Xcode 15.0 or later installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nand4655/pokemon_nand_kishore.git
   cd pokemon-app
   open PokemonApp.xcodeproj
   ```
3. Build and run the project on a simulator or a physical device.

## Requirements 📋
1. iOS 17.0 or later.
2. Swift 5.7 or later.
3. SwiftUI for the user interface.
